# HolidayFinder IT Project

## Overview
HolidayFinder is an academic project developed as part of our university coursework. The platform fetches holiday offers from various travel agencies and vacation search engines, saving them into a database. Users can then filter and search for their desired holiday packages based on transportation type, location, price range, and number of travelers. Clicking on an offer's image redirects the user to the respective site, like "travelplanet," from which the offer was fetched.

## Features
- Fetch holiday offers from various online platforms.
- Dynamic filtering system allowing users to tailor their search.
- Option to sort offers by price.
- Redirect functionality to the original holiday offer on the external website.

## Known Issues
The platform may encounter issues when the external websites (e.g., travelplanet) undergo design changes, causing our fetching mechanism to malfunction.
