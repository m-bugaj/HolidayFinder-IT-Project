## 🌐 **Overview**
HolidayFinder is an academic project crafted as part of our university course. The platform pulls holiday deals from various travel agencies and vacation search engines, storing them in a database. Users can then filter and search for their dream holiday packages based on transport type, location, price range, and number of travelers. Clicking on an offer's image redirects the user to the respective site, such as "travelplanet", from where the offer was fetched.

## ✨ **Features**
- 🔍 Fetches holiday deals from multiple online platforms.
- 🎛 Dynamic filtering system allowing users to tailor their search.
- 💲 Option to sort offers by price.
- 🔗 Redirect functionality to the original holiday offer on the external website.

## ⚠️ **Known Issues**
The platform may encounter issues when external websites (e.g., travelplanet) make design changes, causing our fetching mechanism to malfunction.
